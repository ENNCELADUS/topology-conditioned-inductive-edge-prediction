# EgoStitch Algorithm Specification (Gate G4 deliverable — spec freeze)

**Status:** G4 spec-freeze draft for review, 2026-07-09. Companion to
`04-model-proposal.md` (revision 2.1+); satisfies gate §6.0-G4: Stitch/Harmonize
pseudocode with tensor shapes, OT cost and ε, confidence and quantile schedule, budget
tolerance, gradient estimators, and the full loss tree with interior weights. Neutral
placeholders per repository convention; no dataset names. Nothing here changes the
model of `04-model-proposal.md` — this document pins the free parameters that document
left symbolic.

**Freeze rule.** Once this spec is approved, implementation may not silently deviate:
any change is an edit here first, with a one-line rationale in §9 (change log).

## 1. Module 1 — Tokenize (per node, cached)

```text
e_u  = MLP_2(d → d_z)(x_u)                                   # encoder
m(u) = argmin_j ‖e_u − c_j‖₂        z_u = c_{m(u)}           # VQ, codebook C ∈ R^{M×d_z}
r_u  = e_u − z_u                                             # continuous residual
F_u  = softplus(MLP_2(d + d_z → C)([x_u; z_u]))              # BP affiliations, ≥ 0
d̂_u = softplus(MLP_2(d + d_z → 1)([x_u; z_u])) · ρ_eval/ρ_train
                                                             # degree budget, density-
                                                             # normalized (ρ = candidate-
                                                             # universe edge density)
stats_u = MLP_2(d_z → 4)(z_u)   # code-supervision head: [deg, clustering,
                                # code-histogram-entropy, motif-conductance] targets
```

- VQ: EMA codebook updates (decay 0.99), straight-through gradient, commitment
  β = 0.25; code-usage entropy regularizer weight in §7.
- Degree NLL: lognormal parameterization (μ, σ from a 2-head MLP) — heavy-tailed
  degrees; the table above shows the mean head.
- All structural targets computed on the **message partition** (§6).

## 2. Module 2 — Imagine (per node, cached; DETR-style decoder)

```text
cond tokens:  T_cond = [W_x x_u; W_z z_u; W_r r_u; W_ζ ζ_u]           # 4 tokens, d_h
cand tokens:  T_g    = W_g proj(x_{g_1..g_{n_g}})                      # n_g tokens, d_h
queries:      Q_k    = W_q [proj(x_{g_k}); z_u] for k ≤ min(K, n_g^+)  # dynamic init
              Q_k    = q_k^base + W_q' z_u      otherwise              # learned base
decoder:      3 layers; self-attn over Q; cross-attn to [T_cond ; T_g ; T_peer]
              (T_peer = partner kept-slot tokens; empty outside harmonization)
heads (per slot k):
  h_u^k ∈ R^{d_p}          slot embedding (projected feature space)
  π_u^k ∈ [0,1]            existence (sigmoid)
  m_u^k ∈ [1, m_max]       multiplicity (1 + softplus, clamped)
  g_u^k ∈ [0,1]            grounding gate (sigmoid) + pointer softmax over T_g
  Â_u ∈ [0,1]^{K×K}        slot–slot adjacency (symmetric bilinear head on h)
CVAE: prior ζ_u ~ N(0, I_{d_ζ}); posterior q(ζ_u | pooled true-neighbor tokens) at
      train; free-bits 0.5 nats/dim; KL annealed 0→1 over first 10% steps.
```

**Conditioning dropout (two nulls, trained):** with p = 0.1 each (disjoint draws):
`∅_content` replaces T_cond by a learned null token (T_g kept); `∅_all` replaces both
T_cond and T_g by nulls. Inference contrasts: TDE control = fused-logit(full) −
fused-logit(∅_content); CFG knob (logit space only): s̃ = s(∅_all) + w·(s(full) −
s(∅_all)), default w = 1 (no guidance) — w ≠ 1 reported only as an analysis arm.

**Hub policy (targets when |N(u)| > K):** stratified importance subsample of N(u) —
proportional allocation over neighbor-code strata, capped at K targets; per-target
multiplicity label = stratum_size / allocated_count. Matching supervises (h, π, m)
against the subsample; degree NLL keeps the true |N(u)|.

**Hungarian matching (compound cost, per node):**

```text
C_{k,v} = 1·‖h_u^k − proj(x_v)‖₂² + 0.25·|deg_bucket(k) − deg_bucket(v)|
        + 0.25·1[code(h_u^k) ≠ code(x_v)] + 0.25·overlap_penalty(k, v)
```

`overlap_penalty` = disagreement between Â row of slot k and A row of v restricted to
currently matched pairs (second Hungarian pass; first pass uses the first three
terms). Assignment is recomputed per step and **treated as a constant** in the
backward pass (standard DETR practice). **Denoising queries:** 25% of training nodes
add K/2 extra queries initialized at noised true-neighbor projections
(σ_noise = 0.1) with *fixed* assignments — the assignment-flapping stabilizer.
Diagnostic: assignment flip rate between consecutive epochs, logged per degree bucket.

## 3. Module 3a — Stitch (per pair)

```text
Π = Sinkhorn(C^Π, ε = 0.1, 20 iters, unrolled/differentiable)   ∈ R_{≥0}^{K×K}
C^Π_{kk'} = 1·‖h_i^k − h_j^{k'}‖₂² + 0.25·1[code_k ≠ code_{k'}] + 0.25·|π_i^k − π_j^{k'}|
marginals: a_k ∝ π_i^k m_i^k ;  b_{k'} ∝ π_j^{k'} m_j^{k'}   (unbalanced OT, KL
           relaxation τ_OT = 1.0 — slots may be unmatched)
```

Scaffold `T̂_ij`: nodes = {i, j} ∪ slots(i) ∪ slots(j) (2K+2; aligned slots kept as
distinct nodes joined by alignment edges weighted Π_{kk'}). Node features =
`[proj feature; one-hot anchor label (5); π; g]`. Edges: star edges (u,k) weighted
π_u^k; slot–slot edges weighted Â; alignment edges weighted Π. Anchor labels:
endpoint-i / endpoint-j / slot-of-i / slot-of-j / grounded-identity-match.

## 4. Module 3b — Harmonize (per pair; trained; algorithm box)

```text
Inputs: S_i, S_j (cached), d̂_i, d̂_j, R
B_u   := min(d̂_u, K·m_max)                # K-representable budget
τ_b   := 0.1 · B_u                        # budget tolerance
conf_k := 0.5·π̂_k + 0.5·exp(−‖h_k − c_nn(h_k)‖₂² / τ_c),  τ_c = median intra-code
          distance on validation; π̂ = temperature-calibrated π (scalar T fit on
          held-out real ego-nets, required)
for r = 1..R:
    γ_r := cos(π/2 · r/R)                            # keep fraction schedule (MaskGIT)
    per scaffold: KEEP the top (1−γ_r)·2K slots by conf; grounded slots (g_k > 0.5)
        get re-mask probability ×0.25 (reduced, not exempt)
    CRITIC: p_remask(k) ← p_remask(k) · (1 + critic(h_k, Â_k·)) — critic is a 2-layer
        scorer trained on real-vs-generated slot neighborhoods; MAY re-mask kept slots
    BUDGET: if Σ_k π_u^k m_u^k ≥ B_u − τ_b: freeze (mask) further slot activations and
        closure edges incident to u for all later rounds       # scaffold-level only
    RE-DECODE masked slots of each side with T_peer = partner kept slots
    if r == 1: recompute Π; else: Π frozen
Output: T̂_ij; diagnostic: slot-agreement trajectory agree_r = Σ Π_{kk'} conf_k conf_{k'}
```

**Joint training task:** sample message-partition pairs (u,v) — 50% adjacent / 50%
random (label-agnostic, R8) — mask each ego-net at ratio ~ U(0.3, 1.0), run 1–2
harmonization rounds, supervise re-decoded slots by the §2 matching losses.
**Gradient estimators:** keep/re-mask = straight-through on the binary keep mask;
budget trigger = detached comparison + soft mirror penalty
`0.1·ReLU(Σπm − B_u)²` so the constraint surface reaches gradients; Sinkhorn unrolled;
critic trained with its own BCE, gradients not propagated into h (detached input).

## 5. Module 4 — Decision head (per pair)

```text
s0 = pair_logit(i, j)                                    # frozen B0
s1 = ½[ lse_k(κ(h_i^k, proj(x_j)) + log π_i^k m_i^k) + (i↔j) ],  κ = −‖·‖₂²/τ_κ
s2 = Σ_{kk'} Π_{kk'} π_i^k π_j^{k'}  and AA variant Σ Π π π / log(1+deĝ)
s3 = [1 − exp(−F_i·F_j);  d̂_i;  d̂_j;  Σπm/B_i;  Σπm/B_j]        # post-harmonization
s4 = MLP_2([H_i; H_j; H_T; spec(T̂)])   from a 3-layer edge-weighted GNN over T̂_ij
     (anchor-labeled; spec(T̂) = [λ_2, λ_max, triangle count, density] of T̂)
p_ij = σ( s0 + g_θ(s1..s4) · w ),   g_θ = MLP_2(gate), w learned scalar init 0.1
```

Required diagnostic: Pearson/Spearman correlation matrix of (s0..s4) on validation
queries, reported with every headline table.

## 6. Data partitions and leakage rules

- Training graph edges split **80% message / 20% supervision** (per seed). All
  structural targets (reconstruction, degree NLL, BP-NLL, code stats, seam references,
  critic training) use message edges only; `L_edge` positives/negatives come from
  supervision edges (+ post-masking negatives). Leave-one-out: when a supervision pair
  (u,v) is in the batch, v is excluded from u's targets and |N(u)| decremented.
- Seam references: unions of message-partition ego-net pairs sampled 50/50
  adjacent/random with labels marginalized.
- B0 provenance audit is an E5 gate precondition.

## 7. Loss tree (interior weights; pre-registered defaults)

```text
L = L_edge + λ_real·L_real + λ_ssl·L_ssl + λ_recon·L_recon
λ_recon = 1.0    λ_real = 0.5    λ_ssl = 0.1        # sweep grid: each ∈ {0.25×, 1×, 2×}

L_edge  = BCE(p_ij, y)                                              # master
L_recon = 1.0·L_feat(Hungarian, Huber) + 0.5·L_exist(BCE, ∅-balanced)
        + 0.25·L_mult(NLL) + 0.5·L_deg(lognormal NLL)
        + 0.5·L_slotadj(group-level BCE | bandwidth variant)
        + β_KL·KL(free-bits 0.5)                     β_KL annealed 0→1
        + 0.5·L_BP(NOCD balanced NLL) + 0.25·L_VQ(commit β=0.25, EMA codebook)
        + 0.25·L_codestats(Huber) + 0.05·L_entropy(code usage)
        + 0.5·L_joint(harmonization re-decode task, §4)
        + 0.25·L_gate(partner-vs-peer BCE on grounding gate)
L_real  = 0.5·ED(ego-stat vectors) + 0.25·ED(random-GIN embeddings)
        + 0.25·ED(seam overlap stats)                [+ 0.1·adversarial, off by default]
L_ssl   = 0.5·consistency(feature noise σ=0.05) + 0.5·pool-resample consistency
          (applied to ungrounded slots only; mean g^k logged)
```

Balancing: fixed weights above; gradient-norm per family logged; uncertainty-weighting
(Kendall) is the registered fallback if any family's gradient norm drifts > 10× from
the median for > 1k steps.

## 8. Training schedule, HPO parity, determinism

1. **Warm-start** (Modules 1–2): `L_recon` only, 20% of budget.
2. **+ Joint harmonization task**: add `L_joint`, 20%.
3. **Full joint**: all losses, 60%; early stopping on validation edge AUPRC
   (VAL-CRITERION), patience 10 evals.
- **HPO parity:** every ladder method (B0…B5, `B3-full`, `Ours`) gets the same tuning
  budget: 30 configs × 3 seeds, random search over its declared grid, frozen and
  recorded in the run-metadata store before held-out metrics are opened.
- **Determinism:** fixed seeds for CVAE samples (n_s = 4, averaged p_ij), Sinkhorn
  iterations fixed, harmonization schedule deterministic given seed. One inference =
  one seed set; reported metrics average 3 seeds.

## 9. Change log

- 2026-07-09: initial freeze draft (from 04-model-proposal.md rev 2.1 §4 + panel
  findings R1-W1/W2/W6, R3-W1/W2/W4/W5/W7).

**Open items before code (not blockers to reviewing this spec):** benchmark feature
dim `d`; candidate-universe densities ρ for the budget normalization; the four
ego-stat target definitions pinned to evaluator implementations; FLOPs/latency table
template (§4.7 commitment).
